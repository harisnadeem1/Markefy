            What are code snippets?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Code snippets are small, reusable pieces of code that solve a specific problem or provide a particular functionality. Instead of reinventing the wheel every time you start a project, snippets act like building blocks that can be quickly integrated into your website, app, or store.

They often include ready-to-use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React components, or Shopify Liquid sections that follow best practices. For developers, snippets are like a personal toolkit that reduces repetitive work. For non-developers, they offer a plug-and-play solution without having to write everything from scratch.
